An intelligent legal assistant that combines semantic search with legal citation network analysis.

## Overview

**Stare Decisis AI** is an intelligent legal assistant designed to navigate the complexity of the US Common Law system. Unlike traditional keyword-based search engines, which fail to capture legal nuance, this project utilizes a **Graph RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** architecture.

By transforming **7791 raw legal documents** (Texas Criminal Reports) into a Knowledge Graph, the system can identify relevant precedents based on **semantic similarity** via `text-embedding-004` and **legal authority** (Citation Network Analysis), generating strategic defense memos in real-time.

----

## Key Features

* **Hybrid Retrieval Engine:** Combines **Vector Search** (to find similar facts using `text-embedding-004`) with **Graph Traversal** (to find authoritative precedents cited by those cases).
* **Citation Network Analysis:** Traverses the graph (Depth 1-2) to uncover the "legal pillars" behind a case, identifying winning strategies (e.g., *Reversed* judgements).
* **Strategic Filtering:** Allows users to filter results based on the desired outcome (e.g., *Defense/Acquittal* vs. *Prosecution/Conviction*).
* **LLM-Driven Extraction (Gemini 2.5):** Utilizes the advanced reasoning of **Google Gemini 2.5** to extract structured metadata (Offense, Punishment, Decision, Conviction) from unstructured 19th-20th century texts with high precision.
* **Interactive Visualization:** Features a dynamic graph visualization to explore the connections between the user's case and historical precedents.

## Architecture

The system operates in two main phases: **The Builder** (Batch Processing with Gemini 2.5) and **The Assistant** (Inference with Gemini 2.0).

### LLM Engineering
We implemented a multi-model architecture to leverage the best strengths of each LLM version:

* **High-Fidelity Extraction (Gemini 2.5):** We used **Gemini 2.5** for Zero-Shot extraction of structured data from 19th-century legal texts. Its superior reasoning capabilities ensured accurate parsing of complex schema fields like `Offense`, `Punishment`, and `Decision`.
* **Grounded Generation (Gemini 2.0 Flash):** For the RAG phase, we utilized **Gemini 2.0 Flash** due to its speed and long-context window. By grounding the generation strictly in the retrieved graph context, we minimized legal hallucinations.

## Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+
* A running **Neo4j Database** (Desktop or AuraDB).
* A **Google Gemini API Key**.

### 2. Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/denise-df/Gavel-Graph.git](https://github.com/denise-df/Gavel-Graph.git)
cd Gavel-Graph


Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3\. Configuration

Create a `key.txt` file (or set environment variables) for your API keys:

```text
# Inside key.txt
YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
```

Create a `neo4j_pass.txt` for your database password.

### 4\. Running the App

Once the database is populated (see `data_pipeline` scripts), launch the interface:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🔎 Case Study: The "Hybrid" Advantage

To demonstrate the power of **Graph RAG**, we tested a complex query:

> **Query:** *"Can a conviction for burglary be sustained if the defendant entered the house but fell asleep without stealing anything?"*

| Method | Result | Why? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Vector Search (Standard RAG)** | **Irrelevant** | Retrieved cases about *victims* sleeping during a robbery. The model matched the keywords "sleep" and "burglary" but missed the legal context of *intent*. |
| **Stare Decisis AI (Graph RAG)** | **Found Precedent** | Identified *McLemore v. State*, a key precedent where a conviction was **reversed** because the defendant was intoxicated/asleep, failing to prove "intent to commit theft." |

**Why it worked:** The system found a semantically similar case (Anchor) and traversed the citation graph to find the authoritative ruling that the Anchor relied upon.

-----

## Evaluation & Results

We conducted an ablation study comparing **Vector-Only Search** vs. **Graph RAG**.

* **Vector Search:** Efficient at finding textually similar descriptions but often retrieves legally irrelevant cases (e.g., finding *Burglary* cases with "sleeping victims" instead of "sleeping defendants").
* **Graph RAG:** Significantly improves relevance by retrieving the *authoritative cases* cited by the vector matches, successfully identifying procedural defenses (e.g., *McLemore v. State*) that standard search misses.
