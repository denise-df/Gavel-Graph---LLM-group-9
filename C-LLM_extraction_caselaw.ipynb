    "## LLM Knowledge Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Main Objective**\n",
    "To leverage Generative AI (Google Gemini) to \"read\" the unstructured legal opinions and extract structured entities: **Offense**, **Punishment**, and **Appellate Decision**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Technical Logic**\n",
    "This script acts as the \"intelligence layer\" of the pipeline, converting raw text into queryable data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Batch Processing & Context Management:** It processes cases in groups (batches of 10) to maximize API throughput and reduce latency. Crucially, it implements **text truncation** (`head_matter` to 4000 chars, `opinions` to 12000 chars) to ensure the input fits within the LLM's context window (token limit) while preserving the most critical initial sections of the judgment.\n",
    "* **Fault Tolerance & Rate Limiting:** It features a robust network layer with a **retry mechanism** using exponential backoff. This automatically handles API quotas (HTTP 429 Rate Limits) and temporary server instability (HTTP 503) without crashing the pipeline. It also includes \"resume capability,\" skipping IDs that have already been processed.\n",
    "* **Hybrid Output Parsing:** Recognizing that LLMs can be unpredictable (sometimes adding conversational text around the requested JSON), the script uses a **dual-parsing strategy**: it first attempts standard JSON decoding, and if that fails, it falls back to **Regular Expressions (Regex)** to surgically extract valid JSON arrays or objects from the raw text response."

    "### **Technical Logic**\n",
    "This script acts as a quality gatekeeper between the raw AI generation and the database ingestion:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Type Normalization:** It sanitizes the unique identifiers (`id`), converting them from potentially messy strings (with whitespace or quotes) into clean integers. This ensures the JSON data will join correctly with the CSV files created earlier.\n",
    "* **Strict Validation Logic:** It applies a boolean filter: a case is preserved **only if** both the `offense` and `decision` fields are present and non-empty. This prevents the Graph Database from being populated with \"ghost nodes\" that have no legal value.\n",
    "* **Graceful Degradation:** While `offense` and `decision` are mandatory, the script handles the `punishment` field more flexibly. If the LLM failed to extract a punishment (or if none was stated), it defaults the value to `\"None stated\"` rather than discarding the entire case, maximizing data retention without compromising integrity."

    "## Conviction Status Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Main Objective**\n",
    "To perform a specialized, second-pass analysis on the cleaned data to determine a critical boolean data point: **Did the case result in a final conviction?** (True/False).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Technical Logic**\n",
    "While the previous script extracted general text fields, this script performs **binary classification** to enable filtering by \"Winning\" or \"Losing\" precedents:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Targeted Inference:** It inputs the `Offense`, `Punishment`, and `Decision` text generated in the previous step and asks the LLM to interpret the legal outcome. For example, it understands that *\"Judgment Affirmed\"* equates to **True** (Convicted), while *\"Reversed and Remanded\"* equates to **False** (Not Convicted).\n",
    "* **Semantic Normalization:** The script maps various linguistic variations returned by the LLM (e.g., \"guilty\", \"yes\", \"1\", \"affirmed\") into a strict Python **Boolean** (`True`/`False`). This is essential for the Neo4j database, allowing for precise queries like *\"Show me cases where the defense won.\"*\n",
    "* **Batch Efficiency & Resume Capability:** Like the previous extractor, it processes cases in batches (20 at a time) to optimize API costs. It also checks the output file on startup to identify which IDs have already been processed, allowing the script to pick up exactly where it left off in case of interruption.\n",
    "* **Data Validation Layer:** It includes a specific fix to ensure `ID`s are treated as integers (`id_int`), preventing type mismatch errors that could occur when merging data from different sources (JSON vs CSV)."
